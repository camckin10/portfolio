<a href="http://codepen.io/camckin10/pen/oLxrvp">About Me Page</a>

<p>Our first assignment was to create an About Me page. This goal for this assignment was to learn the basics of HTML5/CSS3, and also create an identity while learning to code.</p>

    <a href= "">Hack The Times Screenshots</a>

    <p>Our second assignment was to "hack" into The New York Times website. It was super fun! You can see from my version that I am such a cartoon fan!</p>

     <a href="">Karma Landing Page</a>

       <p>The latest assignment was to build the Karma landing page from scratch. We reviewed the original webpage, and through trial and error, created the same webpage from the ground up. </p>
